# REVIEW_PACKET.md

## 1. ENTRY POINT
**System Entry (Cycle 9 — Distributed Computation):**
Path: `distributed_computation_demo.py`
What it does: Runs a full 3-node distributed computation simulation covering normal operations, controlled divergence (delayed + missing + out-of-order), reconciliation, and distributed invariant enforcement. Generates `distributed_system_report.md`.

**Previous Entry Point (Cycles 1–8):**
Path: `node_network_simulation.py`
What it does: Foundational multi-node simulation verifying state consensus and invariants across 3 nodes. Still valid; Cycle 9 builds on top without modifying it.

---

## 2. CORE EXECUTION FLOW

**Module Layer (Cycle 9 — Additive, no core modification):**

**File 1:**
Path: `distributed_state_propagation.py`
What it does: Extends `DistributedStateNode` into `PropagatingStateNode` with partial state snapshots, batch merge, delayed delivery, and consensus checking. Adds `PropagatingHub` with selective delivery for divergence simulation.

**File 2:**
Path: `computation_protocol.py`
What it does: Defines the full proposal→sequencing→execution pipeline. `ProposalMessage`, `SequencedEvent`, `AckMessage`, `SyncReport`, `ExecutionReceipt`. `ComputationProtocolHub` is the authoritative causal sequencer. Halts system on rejection or consensus failure.

**File 3:**
Path: `divergence_simulation.py`
What it does: Simulates 3 controlled divergence scenarios (delayed node, missing event, out-of-order delivery) without breaking system state. Each scenario detects divergence deterministically.

**File 4:**
Path: `reconciliation_engine.py`
What it does: `ReconciliationEngine` identifies lagging nodes, fetches missing events from Hub log, replays in strict causal order, verifies hash convergence. Guarantees same final hash, no duplicate application.

**File 5:**
Path: `distributed_invariant_check.py`
What it does: `DistributedInvariantChecker` runs per-node Cycle 1–8 invariants + global hash consensus. Emits `system_should_halt=True` on any failure. `run_and_halt_if_failed()` enforcer halts the Hub directly.

**File 6:**
Path: `distributed_computation_demo.py`
What it does: Full end-to-end simulation: normal ops → divergence → reconciliation → final invariant check + consensus proof. Generates `distributed_system_report.md`.

**Foundation Layer (Sealed, Cycles 1–8):**

**File 7:**
Path: `distributed_state_node.py`
What it does: `DistributedStateNode` — foundational causal-event-buffered node. Parent class for all Cycle 9 nodes.

**File 8:**
Path: `full_stack_integration_harness.py`
What it does: Core execution engine maintaining Hilbert-space bounds, Cycles 1–8 invariants. Sealed — not modified by Cycle 9.

## 3. LIVE EXECUTION FLOW

**Input:**
Initial state: `|0⟩` across 3 nodes. Operations: H gate, X gate, Measurement (seed=42). Divergence scenarios injected mid-run.

**Flow (Cycle 9):**
```
Node proposes (ProposalMessage)
  → Hub sequences (assigns causal_id, creates SequencedEvent)
    → All nodes execute (ProtocolNode.execute_sequenced_event)
      → AckMessage returned (APPLIED | BUFFERED | REJECTED)
        → SyncReport for SYNC steps
          → Divergence detected (partial nodes, hash mismatch)
            → ReconciliationEngine replays missing events
              → DistributedInvariantChecker validates globally
                → Final consensus: all hashes match ✓
```

---

## 4. REAL OUTPUT (Cycle 9)

**Divergence detection example (Scenario B — Missing Event):**
```
Node_A: committed_id=3, partial=False, hash=<ref>
Node_B: committed_id=1, partial=True,  pending=[3], hash=<stale>
Node_C: committed_id=3, partial=False, hash=<ref>
→ system_should_halt=True
```

**After reconciliation:**
```
Node_A: committed_id=3, hash=7e8ad19c... ✓
Node_B: committed_id=3, hash=7e8ad19c... ✓ (replayed events [2], buffer flushed)
Node_C: committed_id=3, hash=7e8ad19c... ✓
→ Full consensus reached: True
```

**Previous output (Cycles 1–8, unchanged):**
```
Node_A State Hash: c56bc8...
Node_B State Hash: c56bc8...
Node_C State Hash: c56bc8...
SUCCESS: All nodes arrived at the exact same state hash.
ALL INVARIANTS PASSED ON ALL NODES.
```

## 5. WHAT WAS BUILT IN THIS TASK (Cycle 9)

**New modules added:**
- `distributed_state_propagation.py` — PropagatingStateNode + PropagatingHub
- `computation_protocol.py` — Full protocol pipeline with ProposalMessage → SequencedEvent → AckMessage
- `divergence_simulation.py` — 3 controlled divergence scenarios
- `reconciliation_engine.py` — Deterministic catch-up and convergence engine
- `distributed_invariant_check.py` — Global invariant enforcement with halt authority
- `distributed_computation_demo.py` — Full end-to-end simulation + report generator

**New reports added:**
- `distributed_computation_model.md` — Formal model: computation step, message structure, authority model
- `divergence_report.md` — All 3 divergence scenarios documented
- `reconciliation_report.md` — Reconciliation protocol, determinism proof, duplicate guard
- `distributed_system_report.md` — Generated by demo run (full execution trace + hash proofs)

**What was NOT touched:**
- `cycle1/` through `cycle8/` — sealed, unmodified
- `full_stack_integration_harness.py` — sealed, unmodified
- `distributed_state_node.py` — sealed, unmodified (parent class only extended)
- `node_network_simulation.py` — sealed, unmodified

## 6. FAILURE CASES (Cycle 9)

| Failure | Detection | Response |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Delayed delivery | `PropagatingStateNode.is_partial` | Buffer holds; auto-flush when predecessor arrives |
| Missing event | `is_partial=True`, stale hash at SYNC | `ReconciliationEngine` replays from Hub log |
| Out-of-order delivery | Event buffered, predecessor awaited | Auto-flush, no divergence |
| Duplicate event | `causal_id < next_expected` | Silently skipped, no re-application |
| Invalid operator | `FullStackHarness` rejects | AckMessage.ack_type="REJECTED", Hub halts |
| Consensus failure | Hash mismatch in SYNC report | `DistributedInvariantChecker` emits halt signal |

---

## 7. DETERMINISM PROOF (Cycle 9)

- **Same event log → same final hash:** All nodes processing the same ordered event list from the same initial state produce identical `state_hash`
- **No duplicate application:** `ReconciliationEngine` skips `causal_id < next_expected_causal_id`
- **No state overwrite:** All mutations via `FullStackHarness` transitions only
- **Causal ordering:** `receive_event()` buffers any event with gaps; applies strictly in sequence
- **Single sequencer:** `ComputationProtocolHub` is the only source of `causal_id` assignment

---

## 8. INVARIANT COVERAGE (Cycles 1–9)

- **C1–C8 (local):** Enforced per-node via `FullStackHarness.verify_all_invariants()` — unchanged
- **C9 (global):** `DistributedInvariantChecker` adds:
  - All nodes pass local invariants
  - All nodes agree on state hash (global consensus)
  - No node in partial state (all events committed)
  - System halts if any check fails

---

## 9. PROOF OF EXECUTION

Run `distributed_computation_demo.py` to generate `distributed_system_report.md` with:
- Full execution trace
- State hashes for all 3 nodes (must be identical)
- Event log SHA-256 hash (replay proof)
- Invariant check results at each phase gate
- Reconciliation results (events replayed, convergence confirmed)
